		<h3>Tutorial:</h3>
		<p><b>A tutorial, in education, is a method of transferring knowledge and may be used as a part of a learning process. More interactive and specific than a book or a lecture, a tutorial seeks to teach by example and supply the information to complete a certain task.<b></p>

<p>A tutorial can be taken in many forms, ranging from a set of instructions to complete a task to an interactive problem solving session (usually in academia).</article></p>
<h3>Tutorial class</h3>
<p>In British academic parlance, a tutorial is a small class of one, or only a few students, in which the tutor, a lecturer, or other academic staff member, gives individual attention to the students.[1]

The tutorial system at Oxford and Cambridge is fundamental to methods of teaching at those universities, but it is by no means particular to them; Heythrop College (University of London), for instance, also offers a tutorial system with one-on-one teaching. It is rare for newer universities in the UK to have the resources to offer individual tuition ; a class of six to eight (or even more) students is a far more common tutorial size. At Cambridge, a tutorial is known as a supervision.

In Australian, New Zealand, and South African universities, a tutorial (colloquially called a tute or tut) is a class of 10â€“30 students. Such tutorials are very similar to the Canadian system, although, tutorials are usually led by honours or postgraduate students, known as 'tutors'.</p>
